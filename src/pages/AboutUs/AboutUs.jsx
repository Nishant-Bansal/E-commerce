        The My Store family believes in action, progress, and growth. The young
        startup has achieved several milestones in its active years till now,
        but nothing keeps us from seeking more and more. Since more and more
        people seem to indulge in video, we aim to break our own record in hours
        of video produced. That's not all, we are also determined to become
        HubSpot Elite Partners by the end of 2022.
